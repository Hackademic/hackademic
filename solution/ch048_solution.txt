Challenge 048 : Medium CTF Challenge

Welcome to CTF.
Looks like a simple page with simple source, usually simple pages have most things hidden in them.
Complete White Background Suspicious 

CTRL + A page and scroll down u notice a hint there hidden.. shows "robots.txt"
OR you can also scroll down the source page and get that hint.

User-agent: *
Disallow: /dir/indexX.php			//suspiciuos page

User-agent: *
Disallow: /inside/submit.php			//submit flag page

/inside/submit.php : checking this directory out nothing here, this page is to submit the flag 
/dir/     directory too, nthing here except
/dir/indexX.php : says protected area, enter  the site :
asks for username and password saying : Protected Area !!
admin:admin admin:pass doesnt works so surely, it's not made for guessing

this page heads to /dir/secret/  okay.. but we dont have the username and password for it.

This authentication might be of .htaccess file so let's use curl to check out request methods allowed and use different http methods to this /secret dir. 

curl -X OPTIONS -v http://locahost:8008/dir/secret : we can see all methods are allowed
let's use GET for checking and it gives 200 OK !! WOhhhhh Bypassed !!!

So, the fault in .htaccess file is that.. it just limits and authenticates on POST http method request. 

so if u just type or reload url : http://localhost:8008/dir/secret/    you will be able to access the page :D
 
Good one Wats Next.. It's not as easy as it looks 0_0

(White Background always makes me suspicious)
CTRAL + A --> gives me that "It's not as easy as it looks" is an image okay, 
let's check out the susp image directory
http://localhost:8008/dir/secret/images/its.jpg

there's another file in images/  : image.jpeg
which contains "errors" so let's check out these "errors" save this file first.

image.jpeg
view contents using "strings image.jpeg" or cat or gedit.. it shows.. some random strings.. n also s string name "sec.wav" might be an audio file
using "file image.jpeg" u'll see that it gives zip archive, kk so this a zip file

rename "image.jpeg" --> "image.zip"
extract it : u'll get a wav audio file.. named sec.wav let's check this out 
audio is kind of random, might have something hidden inside it, steganography.
Google out Steganography if u've never heard of this term.

let's figure this audio using Sonic Visualiser
looks like a simple audio file.. let's add sprectrogram filter and there you go --> PIKACHU 

so, this was an image file that was rendered blue and then converted to audio file :D

so the flag is : PIKACHU

Successful !!!

Hope You Learned Some new things and Enjoyed this Challenge !!!
