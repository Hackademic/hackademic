        Government officials have discovered a paid website, which might have illegal activities covering under them, and they have hired you to get the admin login details of this <a href="challenge_7/" target="_blank">SITE</a>. However, they have solved this to an extent and have MITM'd a regular user to get the following credentials { username : scrtusr & password : mint_cinnamon} however this bit of information isn't enough to get to the user's profile or to inject into the website to get admin login details . So, now you have to find out the admin credentials and hand it over to the government officials, so that they can carry out some security checks. Login as admin.<br /><br/></p>

Hints and Tips :
You have the credentials of a user, but his profile is not accessible due to some restrictions the website has setup'd. "You cannot have access to your profile without OurBrowser, *If you are our customer, you would have our paid browser and you would know how to continue". This does lead to something. Check out the http requests, and more importantly You're LOGGED in (atleast as a user). Here's another : Wanna have a Cookie ??<br/><br/><a href = "http://sechow.com/bricks/docs/content-page-3.html">reference1 <p><br/></p>
