       A friend of yours has set up a news blog at <a href="ch009/index.php" target="_blank">slagoff.com</a>.  However, he is kind of worried regarding the security of the news that  gets posted on the blog and has asked you to check how secure it is.<br /> <br /> Your objective is to determine whether any vulnerabilities exist that, if exploited, can grant access to the blog's server.<br /> <br /> Hint: A specially-tailored backdoor shell can be found at "<a href="http://www.really_nasty_hacker.com/shell.txt" target="_blank">http://www.really_nasty_hacker.com/shell.txt</a>".
