<small>
The Police have arrested a team of 20 hackers, belonging to a certain hacker group, who were trying to clone bank websites, in an attempt to intercept bank account numbers belonging to people from foreign countries. According to the Police Force Chief who was in charge of the operation, several people in Italy and Spain have become victims of the aforementioned fraud, as they entered their bank account details to the spurious site. What is more, the hackers had accomplices in these two countries, who withdrew the money that adds up to several hundreds of thousands Euros.

One more hacker, member of the same hacker group, has been arrested for obtaining illegal access to the servers of several US universities and state organisations, such as NASA, using an american IP address to disguise himself. There is nothing surprising here really, as this hacker group is now regarded as being an international threat, since they have repeatedly struck multiple targets.

One of their most important attacks was when they tampered with the data stored in the database of an american trade company, thus managing to steal several tens of millions records related to its customers.
