        Our agents (hackers) informed us that there reasonable suspicion that the site of this <a href="ch001/" target="_blank">Logistics Company</a> is a blind for a human organs'  smuggling organisation.<br /> <br /> This organisation attracts its victims through advertisments for jobs with very high salaries. They choose those ones who do not have many relatives, they assasinate them and then sell their organs to very rich clients, at very high prices.<br /> <br /> These employees are registered in the secret files of the company as "special clients"!<br /> <br /> One of our agents has been hired as by the particular company. Unfortunately, since 01/01/2007 he has gone missing.<br /> <br /> We know that our agent is alive, but we cannot contact him. Last time he  communicated with us, he mentioned that we could contact him at the  e-mail address the company has supplied him with, should there a problem  arise.<br /> <br /> The problem is that when we last talked to him, he had not a company  e-mail address yet, but he told us that his e-mail can be found through  the company's site. <br /> <br /> The only thing we remember is that he was hired on Friday the 13th! <br /> <br /> You have to find his e-mail address and send it to us by using the central communication panel of the company's site.<br /> <br /> Good luck!!!
