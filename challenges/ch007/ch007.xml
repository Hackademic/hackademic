        A good friend of mine studies at Acme University, in the <a href="ch007/index.php" target="_blank">Computer  Science and Telecomms Department</a>. Unfortunately, her grades are not that  good. You are now thinking "This is big news!"... Hmmm, maybe not. What  is big news, however, is this: The network administrator asked for  3,000 euros to change her marks into A's. This is obviously a case of  administrative authority abuse. Hence... a good chance for D-phase and  public exposure...<br /> I need to get into the site as admin and upload an index.htm  file in the web-root directory, that will present all required evidence  for the University's latest "re-marking" practices!<br /> I only need you to find the admin password for me...<br /> <br /> Good Luck!
