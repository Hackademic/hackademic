       A hacker informed us that <a href="ch004/index.php" target="_blank">this</a> site suffers from an XSS-like type of  vulnerability. Unfortunately, he lost the notes he had written regarding  how exactly did he exploit the aforementioned vulnerability.<br /> Your objective is to make an alert box appear, bearing the message "<strong>XSS!</strong>". It should be noted, however, that this site has some protection against such attacks.
