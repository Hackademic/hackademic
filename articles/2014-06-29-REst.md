Synopsis:
----------------
REST allows interaction with a web-based system via simplified URL's rather than complex request body or POST parameters to request specific items from the system.

Description:
------------------ 
REST is a means of expressing specific entities in a system by URL path elements, REST is not an architecture but it is an architectural style to build services on top of the Web. REST allows interaction with a web-based system via simplified URL's rather than complex request body or POST parameters.

Mitigation:
----------------
- RESTful web services should use session based authentication, either by establishing a session token via a POST, or using an API key as a POST body argument or as a cookie. Sensitive information should not appear in the URL. 
BAD PRACTICE : https://example.com/controller/<id>/action?apiKey=a53f435643de32

- XML Input Validation must ensure that they are protected against common XML based attacks by using XML-Parsing.
