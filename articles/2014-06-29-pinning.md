Pinning

Synopsis:
----------------
Pinning is the process of associating a host with their expected X509 certificate or public key. 

Description:
-----------------
Once a certificate or public key is known or seen for a host, the certificate or public key is associated or 'pinned' to the host. If more than one certificate or public key is acceptable, then the program holds a pinset.You should pin anytime you want to be relatively certain of the remote host's id oe when operating in hostile environment.Because applications expect end-to-end security on the secure channels such as VPN, SSL, TLS can be vulnerable.
