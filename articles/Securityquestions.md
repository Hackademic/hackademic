Using Security questions
-->
Synopsis
---------------
This cheat sheet provides some best practice for developers to follow when choosing and using security questions to implement a "forgot password" web application.

Description
-----------------
There is no industry standard either for providing guidance to users or developers when using or implementing a Forgot Password feature. The result is that developers generally pick a set of dubious questions and implement them insecurely. 
Any security question should be memorable,safe,never universal,consistent.

Mitigation
---------------
* Review Any Canned Questions with Your Legal Department or Privacy Officer and  decide on Identity Data vs Canned Questions vs. User-Created Questions.
*  Insist on a Minimal Length for the Answers  and see how securely you can store the Q/A's.
* Periodically Have Your Users Review their questions and update them.
